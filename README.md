The code was created while working through the Udemy tutorial - “Master Node JS & Deno.js, build REST APIs with Node.js, GraphQL APIs, add Authentication, use MongoDB, SQL & much more!” by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

The code contains many comments, some of which are in my native language, but they do not affect functionality.

Some parts of the code are identical to the instructor's, while others were written by me independently.
